# atmosphericCO2-shiftdetection-forecast

Analyze atmospheric CO₂ to detect major trend changes (“regime shifts”) and forecast future levels (next five years)
CO₂ is a key driver of global climate change
Regime shifts can signal critical climate or policy events
Accurate forecasting helps scientists, policymakers, and the public anticipate future risks and guide climate action.
CO₂ levels are rising faster than ever.
